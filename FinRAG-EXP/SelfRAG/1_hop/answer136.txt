问题：目前，全球光伏产业的发展趋势是什么？
答案：As of the information provided, the global photovoltaic industry trends include China's leading position in solar power development, with a significant share of global capacity and installations. In 2018, China had over 174 GW of cumulative grid-connected capacity, accounting for 34% of the global total, and added 44 GW of new installations, making it both the country with the highest annual addition and cumulative capacity worldwide. By 2020, it was forecasted that China would contribute significantly to the global increase in solar power installations, aiming for over 150 GW globally. Technologically, PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) batteries have gained prominence due to their efficiency and cost advantages, with a reported domestic maximum efficiency of 24.03% in single-crystal silicon PERC cells as of 2019.
