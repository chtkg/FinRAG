问题：安踏体育的长期战略和增长前景如何？在当前市场环境下，投资者应该如何看待公司的未来发展？
答案：Anta Sports' long-term strategy is driven by the strong growth of its core brands, particularly the Ananta and FILA retail streams. These segments have shown high double-digit to 50-55% growth in Q4 and mid-double digits to 55%-60% growth for the year. Investors should evaluate factors such as brand expansion, market penetration, product innovation, and strategic acquisitions like Amer Sports to predict Anta's future development and expected returns.
