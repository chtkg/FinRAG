问题：中海油集团的绿色发展战略以及公司未来发展前景如何，在新能源领域布局的意义和潜在风险是什么？

In 2019, CNOOC established a subsidiary, CNOOC Fusion Wind Energy Co., Ltd., to develop and operate a 300MW offshore wind farm project off Zuzhigasha (H2#). This move signifies their commitment to the new energy sector. The significance of this layout lies in contributing to China's clean energy goals and reducing carbon emissions.
