问题：新能源汽车产业链中，各企业如何通过获取政府补助、战略投资等方式来提高自身的竞争力和市场份额？同时，这种趋势对整个新能源汽车行业的发展有何影响？
答案：Companies in the new energy vehicle industry, like Tesla and Panasonic through their joint venture Gigafactory 1, leverage government subsidies by investing strategically in supply chain optimization. This partnership allows them to gain expertise in battery production, which is crucial for market competitiveness. By optimizing their supply chains, these companies can improve efficiency and reduce costs, thereby enhancing their share in the market. The impact of such practices on the overall growth of the new energy vehicle sector includes increased innovation, reduced dependency on external suppliers, and a boost in production capacity, as seen with Gigafactory 1's planned expansion from 35GWh to 150GWh.
