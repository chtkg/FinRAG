问题：如何看待国内餐饮供应链的发展趋势，以及未来供应链运作效率会如何变化？
答案：The current trends in China's food supply chain development include the steady growth of the frozen food market due to rapid restaurant market expansion, increased consumer demands, and improved cold chain logistics. This is supported by data from the Zhongshang Industry Research Institute, which indicates that the frozen food market size was approximately 1342 billion yuan in 2018 and projected to reach 1467 billion yuan in 2019 with a stable annual growth rate of around 9%. In terms of future supply chain operations efficiency, leading companies like Meicai and Shuhai are demonstrating advancements through their significant business volumes; for instance, Meicai reached an annual turnover of $10 billion and Shuhai $3.6 billion in 2018.
