问题：碳化硅模块在新能源汽车领域有何应用前景？
答案：Silicon carbide (SiC) modules have gained significant traction in the field of new energy vehicles due to their efficiency and performance benefits. They are expected to play a pivotal role, potentially occupying about half of the industry's total scale by a certain point in time. Notably, silicon carbide MOSFETs were first introduced into power devices markets by Infineon in 2001, marking a significant milestone for this technology. The use of SiC power devices, like those seen in Tesla Model 3, notably enhances system efficiency and can increase the overall续航里程of vehicles by effectively reducing both conduction and switching losses. Additionally, their compact size allows for reduced space usage within vehicles, making them an attractive option for new energy vehicle manufacturers.
