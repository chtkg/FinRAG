问题：禽流感对旅游业的影响与SARS相比如何？
答案：The impact of Avian Influenza on tourism is generally shorter in duration compared to SARS. While both events led to a decrease in travel and tourism demand, the SARS outbreak had a more prolonged effect due to its longer duration from December 2002 to June 2003. The specific data for tourist attractions, airlines, and hotels show that while there was a significant impact during the time of each event, Avian Influenza's effects were contained within a shorter timeframe from March to July 2013.
