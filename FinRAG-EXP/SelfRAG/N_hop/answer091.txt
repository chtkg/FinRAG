问题：新型冠状病毒疫情对公司的影响？
答案：The distinct COVID-19 effects have significantly influenced various companies across different industries, particularly in sectors like tourism, aviation, and hospitality. During the period when the pandemic was active (from December 2019 to June 2020), there was a notable decrease in demand for these services due to reduced mobility and travel restrictions. This impact can be observed through data from tourist attractions, airlines, and hotels, which experienced a downturn in business activity during that time.
