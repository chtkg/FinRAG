问题：新兴市场领域对软磁材料的需求情况如何？
答案：The demand for soft magnetic materials, particularly non-crystalline (amorphous) ones, is significantly manifesting in rapidly expanding industrial sectors due to their unique properties such as low hysteresis loss and high permeability. This has led to the development of various series like iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) based amorphous alloy tapes by AlliedSignal, which marked a pivotal point in the industrialization of these materials. As a result, non-crystalline soft magnetic materials are increasingly being utilized across multiple sectors due to their efficiency and performance benefits.
