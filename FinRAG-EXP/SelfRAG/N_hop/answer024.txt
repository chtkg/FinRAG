问题：为什么认为旭辉控股2020年的销售额有望稳增？需要考虑哪些因素？
答案：To understand why the expected stable growth in sales for Xindu Holdings in 2020 is anticipated, several factors should be considered. These include an increase in milestone revenue due to more projects being submitted for IND/BLA (Investigational New Drug/Application for Biologics License Authorization), which will likely continue and contribute to a steady rise in profit margins. Additionally, the prediction of higher growth in 2020 is based on the assumption that the company's production and sales scale will recover, coupled with an increase in high-priced vehicle models and improved gross profit margin.
