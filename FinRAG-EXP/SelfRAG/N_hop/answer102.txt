问题：如何解释中海油公司油气储产稳步增长和全球化布局对其盈利的影响，以及公司现金流状况与同行业企业比较时有什么特点？
答案：The steady growth of oil and gas reserves, along with China National Offshore Oil Corporation's global expansion strategy, positively impacts its profitability by maintaining a lower资产负债率 compared to domestic and international competitors. This is evident from the company's financial position in 2019H1, where it had an assets-to-equity ratio of 40.2%, significantly below the average for major oil companies worldwide. Additionally, the corporation's cash flow situation shows stability over a decade, with operating net cash flows consistently within the range of 800-1200 billion yuan annually since 2010. Notably, during periods of rising oil prices in 2017 and 2018, the company experienced improved profitability and cash flow, leading to an increase in dividend payments with an average payout ratio of 64% and a higher average dividend yield of 5.4%, surpassing the industry average of 3.5%.
