问题：疫情如何影响制造业产业链和供应链，以及哪些地区可能受到更大冲击？
答案：The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted international manufacturing supply chains, particularly in regions like China where the virus was first reported. Geographically, areas such as Hubei province and neighboring provinces like Guangdong and Zhejiang have encountered notably severe disruptions due to stringent lockdown measures and trade restrictions. These disruptions have affected global supply chains as these regions are major contributors to international manufacturing activities.
