问题：疫情对供应链和产业链的影响如何？政府会采取什么措施来应对？
答案：The COVID-19 pandemic has affected supply chains and industries by potentially leading to trade restrictions, particularly if the World Health Organization (WHO) designates certain areas as infected. In SARS times, trade limitations were a significant issue due to WHO's classification of affected regions. The government might implement measures such as enhancing logistics efficiency, supporting domestic production, and facilitating international cooperation to address these impacts.
